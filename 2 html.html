        <p><strong>GLOBAL WARMING, the phenomenon of increasing average 
            air temperatures near the surface of Earth over the past one to two centuries. 
             Climate scientists have since the mid-20th century gathered detailed
             observations of various weather phenomena (such as temperatures, precipitation, and storms)
              and of related influences on climate (such as ocean currents and the atmosphere’s chemical composition).
               These data indicate that Earth’s climate has changed over almost every conceivable timescale since the beginning of geologic
                time and that human activities since at least the beginning of the Industrial Revolution have
             a growing influence over the pace and extent of present-day climate change.</strong></p>

                <li>In 2023, the average concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere was 419.3 ppmJump to references1 —
                     the highest in human history and more than 50% higher than pre-industrial levels of CO2. Tweet this fact</li>
                 <li>2023 was the hottest year on record
                Analysis by NOAA shows that average global temperatures in 2023 were 2.12 degrees F (1.18 degrees C) warmer than the
                 20th-century average —
                 and higher than any other year since records began in 1850.Jump to references2 What's more, the 10 warmest years on record have
                  all been in the past decade. </li>
           <li> Fact 3:20% of emissions
                As much as 20 percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestationJump to references3 — 
                exceeding the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet.Jump to references4 Tweet this fact</li>

    <strong>Top 3 facts about global warming</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Changes in migration patters:- some animals rely on specific temperature cues to trigger their migration.</li>
     <li>  Extinction risk:- many species may struggle to adapt to the rapid changes in temperature and other climate-related factors.</li>
      <li> Altered food availability:- warming oceans can cause shifts in the distribution and abundance of marine species,
         affecting the availability of prey for marine animals like whales,dolphins,and seabirds</li>
